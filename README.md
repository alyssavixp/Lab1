# Lab1
2D Godot introduction test with the following parameters:

 - A main scene
 - 2 Different Sprites (Images)
 - Several instances of another scene (like a forest with several trees or rocks)
 - Create a github repository with the godot project inside and a README.md file where you describe the project and write out any questions or things you learned along the way

 #Description
 my 2D game is a Windows XP desktop with two sprites as application icons. The sprite labeled "Food" was created by me on Resprite, meant to resemble a can of food. This game also features a scene of a welcome window that has a jpg of Tatooine at sunset within that window.

 #Development
 Hopefully will turn the sprites into interactive buttons and use this template to practice UX/UI design.
